This project implements a transient, cost-optimized data pipeline on Azure designed to archive the "Idea of the Day" webpage daily. The workflow is orchestrated by Azure Automation, which boots an Azure VM at a scheduled time, triggering a cron job that launches a Docker container. Inside the container, a Python script utilizes Playwright and single-file-cli to render and scrape the target URL into a static HTML file. This file is immediately uploaded to Azure Blob Storage for persistence, after which the script executes a shutdown_self function to programmatically deallocate the VM using its managed identity, ensuring compute resources are only consumed during active processing. The infrastructure is supported by a CI/CD pipeline where GitHub Actions builds and pushes updated Docker images to the Azure Container Registry upon code commits, while the front-end is served by a Flask application running on Azure App Service that dynamically lists and renders the archived HTML blobs from storage.
